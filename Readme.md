Weâ€™re building StayFinder, a full-stack web app similar to Airbnb, where users can list and book properties for short-term or long-term stays. This intern project will give you experience across both frontend and backend development.
âœ… Objectives:
Build a functional prototype with:
Frontend: Property listing, search, details page, login/register
Backend: RESTful API for listings, user auth, bookings.
Database: Store users, listings, bookings.
ðŸ“¦ Deliverables:
Frontend (React preferred):
Homepage with property cards (image, location, price).
Listing detail page with images, description, calendar.
Login/Register pages with validation.
(Optional) Host dashboard to manage listings.
Backend (Node.js/Express or Django):
Auth routes: register, login.
Listings endpoints: GET /listings, GET /listings/:id.
POST /bookings for reservations.

Basic listing CRUD for hosts.
Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL):
Models: Users, Listings, Bookings.
Include seed data for testing.

Bonus (Optional):
Search with filters (location, price, date).
Map integration (Google Maps/Mapbox).
Mock payment integration (e.g., Stripe).
ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX:
 you can use clean designs from platforms like Dribbble or Figma. Take inspiration from Airbnb, NomadX, etc.
